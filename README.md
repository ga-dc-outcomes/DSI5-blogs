# Blogs

You will submit your ten blog posts via Github so the Outcomes team can check them off in GArnet. Blogs are due by 6:00 PM every Monday.

To submit, add your link to the table below:

| Week          | Link to Blog 				 	|
| ------------- | ------------------------------|
| Week 1        | `null` (do not edit)			|
| Week 2        | `null` (do not edit)			|
| Week 3        | https://bricewolfgang.github.io/blog_c4s.html    				|
| Week 4        | https://bricewolfgang.github.io/List_Comp_blog.html     				|
| Week 5        | https://bricewolfgang.github.io/DupeLines.html      				|
| Week 6        | https://bricewolfgang.github.io/SQL_EDA_blog.html						|
| Week 7        | https://bricewolfgang.github.io/Cluster_check.html						|	
| Week 8        | https://bricewolfgang.github.io/Dice_blog.html						|
| Week 9        | https://bricewolfgang.github.io/Dummies.html						|
| Week 10       | https://bricewolfgang.github.io/Top_5_dummies.html					|
| Week 11       | https://bricewolfgang.github.io/code_like_a_hacker.html						|
| Week 12       | https://bricewolfgang.github.io/MVP_EDA.html						|

If you have already written a blog post for week 2, simply make it be your week 3 blog post. Treat the week columns like slots, not explicit dates. **Every week (slot) should have a link except for weeks 1 and 2.**

If you want your readme of blog posts to be added to the repo, rename your `readme.md` to say something like `readme-myname.md`. We will then add it to repository for your classmates to see at the end of the class.
