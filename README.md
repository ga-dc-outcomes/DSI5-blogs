# Blogs

You will submit your ten blog posts via Github so the Outcomes team can check them off in GArnet. Blogs are due by 6:00 PM every Monday.

To submit, add your link to the table below:

If you have already written a blog post for week 2, simply make it be your week 3 blog post. Treat the week columns like slots, not explicit dates. **Every week (slot) should have a link except for weeks 1 and 2.**

If you want your readme of blog posts to be added to the repo, rename your `readme.md` to say something like `readme-myname.md`. We will then add it to repository for your classmates to see at the end of the class.
